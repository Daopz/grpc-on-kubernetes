# grpc-on-kubernetes

This repository contains materials that I plan on using for my 2020 conference presentations.
The goal of the talk is to demonstrate how to run gRPC clients and servers on Kubernetes.
We will walk through a variety of deployment configurations.
Each will demonstrate both simple and complex use cases.
