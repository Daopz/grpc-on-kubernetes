# Namespaces

A [Namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/) in Kubernetes can be thought of as a virtual cluster.
It provides a logical resource container that we can provide resource quotas, network policies, and RBAC.

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/00-init/
```
